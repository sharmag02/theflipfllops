## 🧑‍💻 How To Run Locally  

To view or develop the project locally:

1. Clone/download the repository to your machine.  
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.  
3. No build tools or server required (unless your project uses them) — it's a static site.  

---

## 🚀 Deployment  

This project is hosted on **Netlify**, which provides free hosting for static sites.  
Once you push changes to the repo (or to the connected Git branch), Netlify automatically redeploys the site.  

---

## ✅ Good to Know  

- The site uses standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, maybe JS).  
- No backend — easy to maintain and deploy.  
- Suitable for demos, portfolios, landing pages or small web-projects.

## 💡 How to Contribute / Extend  

If you — or someone else — want to contribute / extend the site:

- Fork / clone the repository  
- Add or modify HTML / CSS / JS as needed  
- Test locally by opening HTML files directly  
- Commit and push — if the repo is connected to Netlify, site will auto-deploy  

Feel free to add new pages, assets, styles, scripts as required.
